Q:
ImportError: No module named vectors

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "imusim/all/__init__.py", line 31, in <module>
    exec("import %s" % modname)
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>

    import imusim.maths.vectors as vectors

A:

This is a problem that occurs when you run python or ipython from the
directory that you installed IMUSim from. Because the 'imusim' directory
containing the code is present there, Python tries to import the
packages from this location rather than the location they have been
installed to. This fails because the parts which were compiled from C
(including imusim.maths.vectors) are not found there.

There are two solutions, either should work:

1. Simply change to any other directory before running ipython.

or:

2. Tell setup.py to build the extensions in place:

        python setup.py build_ext --inplace

(adding the --compiler=mingw32 -liberty options if using MinGW)
